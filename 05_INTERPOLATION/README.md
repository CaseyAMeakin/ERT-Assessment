# Assessment: Interpolation

### Description (original problem statement)

> Using any language and plotting packages you like, interpolate the given point location values to a structured grid of longitude and latitude locations. This task will ask the candidate to implement a procedure that interpolates known grid points and values to a structured grid.

> You are free to choose any interpolation method you like.  The spatial grid should have 50 rows and 70 columns with a longitude range [121.0, 131.0] and latitude range [10.0, 16.0].  Provide a plot of your results - including a short summary on the interpolation procedure you implemented.

> The plot below just illustrates the known value locations (blue) and the grid point locations (red), to be
interpolated.
